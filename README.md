📝 To-Do App
This is a beginner-level To-Do List application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add, delete, and manage tasks in a simple and interactive interface. This project helped me strengthen my core frontend development skills and practice DOM manipulation with JavaScript.
